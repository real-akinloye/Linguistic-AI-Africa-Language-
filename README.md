# Linguistic AI: African Language and Dialect Expansion

## Vision

Develop a comprehensive, AI-powered platform that recognizes, preserves, and empowers every African language, dialect, sub-dialect, and sibling tribe language as unique and valuable. This includes:
- Treating each dialect and sub-dialect as a distinct linguistic entity, not merely a variant.
- Creating tools and modules for automatic translation between even closely related dialects (e.g., Ibadan ↔ Egba ↔ Awori).
- Building, training, and expanding African language modules for AI/NLP applications.

---

## Why This Matters

- **Linguistic Diversity:** Nigeria alone has 700+ languages and dialects, many of which are underrepresented in digital systems and AI.
- **Cultural Preservation:** Each dialect encodes unique knowledge, worldview, and history.
- **Empowering Communication:** Enabling translation and understanding between even closely related communities promotes unity, education, and cultural pride.
- **African-Led AI:** Ensuring African languages are first-class citizens in global AI and tech.

## Goals

1. **Comprehensive Language & Dialect List**
   - Document all Nigerian (and later, African) languages, dialects, sub-dialects, and their relationships.
   - For each dialect: list the “mother” language, population, region, and classification.

2. **AI Module Development**
   - Build modular, extensible AI models for translation, classification, and generation—starting with Nigerian languages and dialects.
   - Enable translation not just between major languages, but between dialects (e.g., Ibadan ↔ Egba, Egba ↔ Awori, etc.).

3. **Open Collaboration**
   - Crowdsource data, speakers, and linguistic expertise from across Africa.
   - Expand to more African languages and dialects over time.

## Nigerian Languages and Dialects

The core dataset is stored in `nigerian_languages_dialects.json` in this directory.

Example fields:
- `dialect_language`
- `mother_language`
- `population_estimate`
- `regions`
- `language_family`

---

## Python Utilities

Included:  
- `language_and_engineering_utils.py` — Load, query, and display both the language/dialect dataset and the Thunder Trapping Ifa model.

Run:
```bash
python linguistic-ai/language_and_engineering_utils.py
```

---

## How to Contribute

- **Data:** Add dialects, population estimates, regions, and relationships to `nigerian_languages_dialects.json`.
- **Code:** Collaborate on language data pipelines, AI model architectures, and evaluation tools.
- **Linguistic Expertise:** Help with classification, annotation, and verification of languages and dialects.
- **Community:** Share resources, stories, and encourage speakers to participate.

---

## Looking Forward

- Expand from Nigeria to all African countries and regions.
- Build translation and recognition models for as many African languages and dialects as possible.
- Partner with universities, cultural organizations, and language communities.
